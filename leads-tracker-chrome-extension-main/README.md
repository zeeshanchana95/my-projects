# Project: Leads Tracker Google Chrome Extension

## Description:
In this project, I created a Google Chrome Browser extension named ""Leads Tracker"" to track the websites.

## Features:
Using this extension, users can
- save any URL of websites that visit via explicitly adding a URL and then save
- can directly save the URL of any active window by clicking on ""save tab"" button
- delete all URLs
- URLs remain persistent even you refresh the window

## Output:
